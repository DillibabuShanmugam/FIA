      "The differences between the non-faulty core and the faulty core at clock cycles 13 and 14 indicate discrepancies in various registers, suggesting that the faulty core is exhibiting different behavior than expected. Let's analyze the differences and their potential causes step-by-step:\n",

      "  \n",
      "  The faulty core seems to be one instruction behind, suggesting that either it did not fetch the next instruction correctly or there was an unexpected stall.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clock Cycle 14**: \n",
      "  - Non-faulty: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (PC = F040)\n",
      "  - Faulty: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]` (PC = F03A)\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The faulty core continues to demonstrate a discrepancy in the instruction flow, indicating it may have executed an incorrect or unexpected instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Instruction Source Binary Register (inst_src_bin_reg)**:\n",
      "- Non-faulty: `[0, 0, 1, 1]` (3)\n",
      "- Faulty: `[1, 1, 0, 0]` (C)\n",
      "\n",
      "The instruction source indicates that the faulty core is attempting to fetch a different instruction than the non-faulty core, possibly resulting from an incorrect fetch or decoding process.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Instruction Move Register (inst_mov_reg)**:\n",
      "- Non-faulty: `[1]` (1)\n",
      "- Faulty: `[0]` (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "The faulty core is not performing the expected move operation, which could lead to further discrepancies in the register values.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Instruction Jump Binary Register (inst_jmp_bin_reg)**:\n",
      "- Non-faulty: `[0, 0, 0]` (0)\n",
      "- Faulty: `[1, 1, 1]` (7)\n",
      "\n",
      "The faulty core seems to be attempting a jump operation that the non-faulty core does not, which may lead to a completely different execution path.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. **Instruction ALU Register (inst_alu_reg)**:\n",
      "- Non-faulty: series of zeros (000)\n",
      "- Faulty: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]` (803)\n",
      "\n",
      "The faulty core is indicating that it is trying to perform ALU operations that the non-faulty core is not executing, which can lead to incorrect results or state changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Causes of Discrepancies\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Corruption**: The data that the faulty core is using for execution could be corrupted. This could happen due to hardware faults or issues in memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Faulty Logic in Frontend**: Issues in the frontend processing where instructions are fetched and decoded may cause the core to interpret instructions incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Timing Issues**: If there are timing discrepancies in signal propagation, it could lead to misalignment of instruction fetching and execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Register Initialization Errors**: If the registers were not initialized correctly, this could lead to different behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bypassing Redundant States**: The faulty core may have bypassed redundant states due to a failure in the control logic that normally handles state transitions, especially if there are hardcoded paths in the instruction flow based on the programâ€™s state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Scenarios and Root Causes\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Glitch or Transient Fault**: A transient fault (like a voltage spike) could have altered the execution flow, causing the processor to read from an incorrect memory address or to misinterpret instruction bits.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Configuration Error**: If the core was configured incorrectly (e.g., in terms of instruction set or pipeline stages), it might lead to executing the wrong set of instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Uninitialized State**: If certain registers were not properly initialized, the faulty core may have started executing from an undefined or unexpected state.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Micro-architectural Bug**: There might be a bug in the micro-architecture that allows the faulty core to skip validation checks, leading to incorrect instruction execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the discrepancies seen in the faulty core compared to the non-faulty core are indicative of underlying issues in instruction fetching, execution, or register management. Further debugging at the micro-architectural level, along with checks for data integrity and hardware faults, would be essential to pinpoint the exact cause of these discrepancies.\n"
